If your budget is around ~15k, and if you are looking for a monitor, then you’re at the right place. A 27 inch monitor is a sweet spot for most of the users since it provides good ergonomics like occupying less space than other wide sized monitors yet makeing it easy for multi tasking like for coding where you have to work on multiple tabs and code editors at the same time, for gamers to provide immersive big screen experience, for readers and editors for effective notes makings.

**Things to notice while purchasing a monitor online:** Availability, Refresh rate, Multiple ports, Ergonomics, Panel, Eye strain, HDR and serviceability. We would go through all of these and get to a conclusion on what to buy. 

Most best monitors available online are available for delivery in all the pin codes. So the other things are the ones which we should be concerned more about. For a monitor, the refresh rate guides the smoothness of the image on the screen. It is the rate at which the image refreshes per second(measured in Hz); the higher the number smoother the experience.  

In case you have to connect it to your laptop or any other display, having multiple ports is always essential. Even though there are no multiple ports, there are converters that can do the hack, but at an extra cost, and we don’t want that. Do not go for the monitors with VGA ports, they are almost extinct these times. Go for a monitor that supports HDMI - It is universal and supports audio and video. Almost all laptops these days provide HDMI ports to connect them with external displays like monitors or Televisions. Also, if we also get a Display Port(DP), it is an added advantage. DisplayPort – better for high refresh rate and resolution.

Coming to ergonomics - go for a light weight, bazel less monitor with height and tilt adjustment and that one which supports VESA mount, to mount it to wall or an arm if needed. HDR (High Dynamic Range) will make the brighter areas brighter and darker ones darker to provide great visual feat. Go for atleast HDR10 or HDR10+ monitors. HDR10 or HDR10+, along with more than 400 nits brightness, is a good deal in 15K.

Panel type is one more important thing to be taken into account. Do not go for VA or TN panels. Go for at least an IPS panel. If we are getting an LED alternative(OLED, QLED) in 15K, then it is a must-consider deal. LED provide greater viewing angles and colour accuracy. The second option to consider is IPS panels, which come in a 15k budget. Most monitors in this range are LED-lit IPS panels, which are a good all-rounder. In this display, the white LED light shines through an LCD layer. The IPS panel in the front controls how this light should pass through. Overall, it is a nice display in terms of viewing angles. 
Also, one more thing we might see is Response time (calculated in milliseconds); the lower, the better. Higher response rates might cause blurred motion during fast-moving images and affect the viewing experience. One more is the sRGB/AdobeRGB % coverage, which measures the true-to-life colors; the higher the percentage, the better it is. Since we are planning a monitor for long hours of usage, go for an eye-care-certified display. There are many brand names for eye care or blue light shields provided by different makers like Acer Vision Care, Anti Flicker Tech, etc., but truly anything is good.

So, since we have understood all the technical aspects that we should consider while buying, let's decide on the bagger deal now. All the top picks below provide 3yr warranty.  Our first pick would be AOC 27G4E (27G2) and second would be LG UltraGear 27GS65F. But at the places where AOC has narrower service reach, LG UltraGear 27GS65F is a great option too.
