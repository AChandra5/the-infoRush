If you've been checking out the latest smartphones in 2025, you might have noticed specs mentioning "LPDDR5 RAM." But what exactly is LPDDR5 RAM? And does it really matter when buying your next phone? Let's break it down in simple words in the infoRush way!

### LPDDR5 RAM
RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It's the temporary memory that your phone uses to keep apps, games, and tasks open and running smoothly.
- LP stands for Low Power, meaning it consumes less battery.
- DDR stand for Double Data Rate, a method used to move information faster by sending data two times during one cycle of the clock. In older systems, data would be sent only once in each clock cycle, usually when clock goes up. In DDR we take advantage of both up and down so you can transfer twice as much information without making the clock run faster.
- DDR5 means it's the 5th generation of Double Data Rate memory. LPDDR5 RAM = faster performance + lower battery usage compared to older RAM versions like LPDDR4X.
