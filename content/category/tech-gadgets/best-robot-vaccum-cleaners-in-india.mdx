In India, the robot vacuum cleaners can be divided into 3 segments - Budget Segment: Under ₹15,000, Mid-Range: ₹15,000 – ₹25,000, Upper Mid-Range: ₹25,000 – ₹35,000. Lets dive into why should we get one. 

Consistent Daily Cleaning Without Effort - Schedule and forget
Improves Health & Hygine - Regular cleaning = reduce allergens and cleanliness improved in homes with pets and kids. Some cleaners have HEPA filters which can trap fine dust and allergens better than traditional sweeping.
Great for Working families and Busy Parents
Cost -Effective Over Time - Lasts for 3-5 years. So we hit breakeven in ~9-12 months

There are some important things to watch and learn about a robot cleaning mop while deciding to purchase one - Smart features(for scheduled cleaning, app/voice control, Mapping the house area etc.,), **Battery life, Cleaning solutions(Wet and Dry cleaning + mopping), Noise levels, Suction capacity, Run time**. In this post, we will cover the  Mid-Range cleaners, and in subsequent posts, we will also cover the budget and premium segments as well. 

Best robot vacuum cleaners under 25,000
Firstly, let's learn about the tech we get in this budget. Mostly, we see 
**LiDAR**
- LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). It sends laser beams around to detect walls, furniture, and obstacles. 
- Creates accurate 2D floor maps in real time. 
- Used in <b><a href="https://amzn.to/43UAB2u" target="_blank">ILIFE A20 Pro</a></b>, Dreame D10s, <b><a href="ILIFE T10 S" target="_blank">ILIFE T10 S</a></b>vacuum cleaners.
- Works well even in the dark.
- Enables smart zonal cleaning, restricted areas, and room memory.

**3D Mapping (LiDAR + Structured Light / AI Camera)**
- Combines LiDAR with 3D camera vision to understand real-world shapes like toys, wires, and shoes — not just walls. So it has advanced object detection.
- Also provides depth to mapping decreasing the chances of getting stuck.
- Used in <b><a href="https://amzn.to/3E7iHz6" target="_blank">Narwal Freo X Plus</a></b>.
- Gyro + Basic Sensors (<b><a href="https://amzn.to/4imEUah" target="_blank">Ecovacs Y1 Pro</a></b>)
- Basic gyroscope(measures rotational moment) + infrared sensors used for mapping.
- Good for open floors, not great in cluttered spaces. Follows patterns like “S” or “Z” shape, but less accurate.
- Used in <b><a href="https://amzn.to/4imEUah" target="_blank">Ecovacs Y1 Pro</a></b>
