Test cricket is the oldest and most respected format of the game. While T20s bring in crowds and ODIs pack drama into one day, Test cricket is where technique, temperament, and true cricketing greatness are measured. It‚Äôs not just about runs and wickets‚Äîit‚Äôs about patience, strategy, and survival.

## What is Test Cricket?
It‚Äôs the ultimate test of skill and endurance.
### Basic Format:
- **Match Duration:** 5 days.
- **Innings:** 4 total (2 per team).
- **Overs:** Unlimited (but minimum 90 overs per day).
### Objective
- Score more runs than the opposition.
- Dismiss them twice.
### An innings ends when:
- The team is all out.
- The captain declares.
- Time runs out.
- The target score is achieved (in the 4th innings).

## üîç Key Test Match Concepts (with Examples)
## **1. Follow-on:** 
 A team batting second can be forced to bat again if it trails (is behind) by:
- 200+ runs in a 5-day match.
- 150 runs in a 4-day match.
- The follow-on is enforced by the team that batted first.

**Follow-on Example:**
- **India vs Bangladesh, 2007 (Mirpur):**
    - India: 610/3 declared
    - Bangladesh: 118 all out.
    - India enforced the follow-on.
    - Bangladesh: 253 all out.
    - üèÜ India won by an innings and 239 runs.

**Why enforce a follow-on?**
- To save time.
- To avoid a draw.
- To take advantage of a deteriorating pitch.

## **2. Declaration:** 
A captain can declare the innings closed at any time to try to bowl out the opposition and force a result.
**Declaration Example:**
- England vs New Zealand, 2023 (Mount Maunganui - Day-Night Test):
    - England: 325/9 declared (in 58.2 overs!).
    - England wanted to bowl under lights with the pink ball for more swing.
    - They dismissed New Zealand cheaply and won the Test.
    - Smart declarations are a hallmark of aggressive modern Test cricket.

## **3. Night Watchman:** 
If a top-order batter is dismissed close to stumps(end of the play day), a lower-order batter (usually a bowler) is sent in as a night watchman to protect the next batter.
**Night Watchman Example:**
- Australia vs England, 2005 Ashes (Edgbaston):
    - Jason Gillespie, a bowler, was sent in as night watchman.
    - He survived tough conditions and helped protect the specialist batters for the next day.

## 4. **Fielding & Bowling Rules:**
 No limit on how many overs a bowler can bowl.
- Each team gets 3 reviews per inning.
- Only 2 fielders are allowed behind square leg to prevent unfair leg-side traps.


### When Does a Test Match End?
**A Team Wins If:**
- They dismiss the opposition twice.
- They chase the target in the final innings.
- Or win by an innings if the opponent‚Äôs two innings combined don't exceed your first innings.

**A Draw Happens If:**
- The match time expires before a result is reached. (e.g., South Africa vs India, Ranchi 2019 ‚Äì rain-affected).

**A Tie Happens When:**
- Both teams have exactly equal scores.
- And the team batting last is all out.
- Tie in a test match is very rare. Only 2 <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/tied-matches-283891" target="_blank">tied Tests</a> ever:
    - Australia vs West Indies (Brisbane, 1960).
    - India vs Australia (Chennai, 1986).

## Why is the Red Ball Used in Test Cricket?
The red cricket ball is iconic and designed for daytime Tests. Its characteristics bring out conventional swing, reverse swing, and subtle seam movement.

        - Spectacular swing under lights created early wickets.

- **üß™ Strategic Masterclass:** Declarations, follow-ons, field settings.
- **üèõÔ∏è Historic Prestige:** The Ashes, Border-Gavaskar, World Test Championship.
- **üèè Pure Skill Showcase:** Swing, spin, bounce, grit‚Äîeverything is on display.

## üóìÔ∏è Latest Test Cricket Stats (2024‚Äì25 Snapshot)
- **Most Test Wickets (Active):** James Anderson (700+).
- **Most Test Centuries:** Sachin Tendulkar (51).
