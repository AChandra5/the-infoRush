A cricket fan cannot forget most matches India has won in difficult circumstances. From India’s first captain C.K. Nayudu to the current era of Rohit Sharma, there have been many iconic moments—some remembered, many forgotten.. Today, we will try remembering some of the most iconic historical moments of Indian cricket. With time, many important moments has faded out in the Virat Kohli’s cover drives and Dhoni’s finishes. 

### 1. Ajit Agarkar’s 6/41 at Adelaide (2003)
This iconic match played at Adelaide has its significance. Known as of the most picturesque venues of cricket in the world, that day in 2003 became more beautiful with Agarker’s roaring spell in the 2nd innings that shook the Australian batting lineup, which made them succumb to 196. In the first innings, they scored a whopping 556 with Ponting’s 242 and India answering it with 523 in their first innings with Dravind’s 233. But in the 2nd innings of the game, Agarkar roared the spell and took 6/41 which was the main reason why India won the match. One more iconic moment in the match was that India won that Test—first win in Australia in 22 years! 

### 2. Kapil Dev’s running backward catch to dismiss Viv Richards (1983 WC Final)
If any person forgets this win, he is not a cricket fan at all! The 1983 WC has many goosebump moments, including India lifting the World Cup for the first time. From a team with zero expectations to a team of winning team, this inspired many cricketers and made many legends out of it. An important turning point of the ‘83 WC Final was the Viv Richards out. Kapil Dev, who gave his everything for the WC win, took an outstanding catch of Viv Richards running backward towards the boundary from mid-on. And it was ‘The Catch’ and the end of the collapse of WI in the final!

While the 1983 win is etched in every fan’s heart, another moment in the 1987 WC proved historic in its own way.

### 3. Chetan Sharma’s Hat-trick (1987 WC)
In the game of cricket, 5-wicket hauls and 10-wicket hauls are as famous as hatricks, gluing the viewers to the television sets for the next 3 balls if a wicket is fallen on the first ball. And what if that is happening in a World Cup? Chethan Sharma became the first cricketer to take a hat-trick in World Cup. He achieved this feat against Newzeland where he clean bowled Ken Rutherford, Ian Smith and Ewen Chatfield off consecutive balls electrifying the atmosphere around.  

### 4. Laxman and Dravid’s 376-run stand at Eden Gardens (2001) 
This match is an eye-catching one. Who said test matches are boring? Bring him on to watch this match. Dravid and Laxman together stood a 376 run partnership against Australia in Eden Gardens. Despite being forced to follow on with 274 runs trailing, the duo took a stand to create a stand and batted the entire day, creating a reverse psychological pressure on the Aussies! India went on to win the match by 171 runs. And it was a historic comeback of the great Indian team which still echoes in the stands of Eden Garden.

### 5. Sachin’s “Desert Storm” innings (Sharjah, 1998) 
Anyone can play in the calm and pleasant weather conditions. But only legends play even in the scorching desert heat, with back-to-back centuries. This famous “desert Storm” (a real sandstorm swept the match, stopping it for a while) inning during the Coca-Cola Cup tri-series final between India-Pakistan-Australia in Sharjah. India lost this match by 26 runs, yet it was remembered for the storming innings played by Sachin (143 off 131 balls). The master blaster showed his true class in this match 

> *"Given the conditions in the month of April - the temperatures are really high, and you can feel the heat going through your shoes and socks - and the first thing you want to do is to put your feet in the ice bucket," Sachin.* 

These moments may not all be trending today, but they helped shape Indian cricket into the powerhouse it is. Sometimes, looking back is the best way to appreciate how far we've come.
