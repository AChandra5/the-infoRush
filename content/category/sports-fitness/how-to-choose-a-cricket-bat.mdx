    <h3>Measurements of the bat</h3>
    <p>We will go through the simple <a href="https://www.lords.org/mcc/the-laws-of-cricket/the-bat">MCC laws</a> (followed by the ICC) of the cricket bat measurements. We might also play a tournament with this bat, so we should buy a legal bat only.</p>
    <p><strong>Length</strong> - cannot be more than 38 inches (96.5 cm).</p>
    <p><strong>Width</strong> - (the face of the bat) cannot exceed 4.25 inches (10.8 cm)</p>
    <p><strong>Depth or Swell</strong> - Maximum 2.64 inches (6.7 cm).</p>

### Choosing the correct handle
Choose the handle of the bat based on your type of play and your height
If you're between 5’6” – 5’11” → Go for a Short Handle bat (most standard choice). With a short handle, we get better control over backlift and can play defensive play as well, like Rahul Dravid does.
If you're 6 feet or taller, or you play with an extended backlift, like Brian Lara → Try a Long Handle bat

### Choosing the handle Type
- If you're a wristy batsman who loves playing flicks, pulls, and helicopter shots, a round handle gives you the flexibility and control you need.
- If you like driving on the front foot and playing with a straight bat, an oval handle provides extra control and better bat face alignment.

### Willow type
- Willow is the wood with which cricket bats are made. Most bats are made of 2 types of willow - English willow and Kashmir willow
- **English willow** - High quality, more fibrous wood and a bit costly, requires regular knocking. Delivers more power and control. If you’re a professional or if you are  having a professional cricket to play near by, go for English willow blindly. 
- **Kashmir willow** - Harder and heavier wood. Slightly less responsive but affordable. Good for non-professional or Gully cricket. If you’re a non-professional and play during vacation or weekend, then Kashmir willow is a better option. This is best for rough use.
Having said that, with the leather ball matches, the English willow bat is preferred in case you are an intermediate or advanced player. Still, there are good options in Kashmir willow as well.

### Weight and pickup of the bat
- The bat’s weight affects your timing, shot selection, and comfort, especially for longer innings.
- Heavier bats have more power, but they can affect your timing if you feel their heftiness.
- "Pickup" refers to how heavy the bat feels in your hands, not just the actual weight.
- A well-balanced bat might feel lighter even if it weighs more — always test the pickup by shadow playing a few shots.
- Do a quick pickup test. Hold the bat with one hand and lift straight up, simulating a front-foot drive. If the wrist strains much and you feel it is heavy, then it's not the right bat for you. If it feels smooth and natural, go for it.

### Maintenance
A good bat can last 2–4 years if you take care of it well. Here's how to extend its life:
- **Knocking:** Always knock in a new bat(even if you purchase a pre-knocked bat) before using it with a <b><a href = "https://amzn.to/3ExNBR8" rel="sponsored" style={{fontSize: "large", textDecoration: "underline"}}>Hard Leather Ball</a></b>.
- **Oiling:** Use <b><a href = "https://amzn.to/42o0IxB" target='_blank' rel="sponsored" style={{fontSize: "large", textDecoration: "underline"}}>Raw Linseed Oil</a></b> on English willow bats(2-3light coats max).
- **Anti-scuff Sheet:** Apply <b><a href = "https://amzn.to/4jAhwHg" target='_blank' rel="sponsored" style={{fontSize: "large", textDecoration: "underline"}}>Anti-scuff Sheet</a></b> to protect the face of the bat.
- **Toe Guard:** Applying <b><a href = "https://amzn.to/42Gyddo" target='_blank' rel="sponsored" style={{fontSize: "large", textDecoration: "underline"}}>Toe Guard</a></b> helps prevent moisture damage and cracks. 
- **Storage:** Keep your bat in a cool, dry place. Never leave it in your car or near moisture.
- **Don’t Overuse:** Rotate bats during nets and matches if possible.
