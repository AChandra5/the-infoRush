The Indian Premier League (IPL) has always been at the forefront of innovation, blending cricket with entertainment. In 2025, the league introduced a unique addition to its lineup: Champak, an AI-powered robotic dog that's been stealing the spotlight and hearts alike.

### Who or What is Champak?

Champak is a 4-legged robotic dog equipped with advanced features, including a mounted camera, allowing it to capture dynamic shots during matches. Developed in collaboration with global broadcast technology companies, this robotic dog made its debut during a match between Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals at Delhiâ€™s Arun Jaitley Stadium.

### Features and Capabilities
Champak isn't just for show; it's packed with functionalities:
- **Mobility ->** It can walk, run,jump, and even stand on its back legs.
- **Camera Integration ->** There is a camera mounted on the top of its back. It provides unique angles, enhancing the viewing experience for fans.
- **Interactive Gestures ->** From handshakes to heart signs, Champak interacts with players and officials, adding a touch of charm to the matches.

These features not only entertain but also offer innovative ways to engage audiences, both in-stadium and at home. 


### Fan Engagement and Naming
Initially unnamed, the IPL organisers turned to fans for suggestions. Through an online poll, "Champak" emerged as the favourite, resonating with many due to its association with a beloved character from the popular TV show "**Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah**." 

Since then, Champak has become a fan favourite, with videos of its antics going viral and players like MS Dhoni and Hardik Pandya interacting with it during matches. 

#### Recent Legal Controversy
Delhi Press, the publisher of the long-standing <a href="https://www.champak.in/about-us" target="_blank">children's magazine "Champak,"</a> filed a <a href="https://cricketaddictor.com/cricket-news/bcci-lands-in-legal-trouble-for-naming-ipl-robot-dog-champak-119272/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">lawsuit </a>against the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for trademark infringement. They argue that the use of the name for the robotic dog could cause brand dilution and confusion. 

The Delhi High Court has sought responses from the BCCI, with the next hearing scheduled for July 9, 2025. 

### The Future of Tech in Cricket
Champak's introduction signifies a broader trend of integrating technology into sports. As leagues seek innovative ways to enhance fan engagement and viewing experiences, AI-powered tools like Champak could become commonplace.

Champak embodies the fusion of technology and entertainment, offering a glimpse into the future of sports broadcasting. While legal challenges loom, its impact on the IPL 2025 season is undeniable, setting a precedent for tech-driven fan engagement in cricket.
