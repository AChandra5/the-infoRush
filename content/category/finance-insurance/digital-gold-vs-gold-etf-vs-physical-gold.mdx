Gold continues to be a trusted form of investment across Indian households. In 2025, investors have more than one way to gain exposure to this precious metal. The three major avenues of gold investmentavailable today are Digital Gold, Gold Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), and Physical Gold. Each comes with distinct costs, tax rules, and levels of liquidity.

This form of gold investment is gaining popularity through the daily use apps like Phonepe, Groww, paytm etc.,

#### Costs
- 3% GST charged upfront on each transaction.
- No annual management fees, but a few platforms levy a small custody fee (~0.3% per annum) after 5 years.
- When you want to redeem your value accumulated as physical form, it incurs minting or delivery charges, typically ranging between 8–10%.

### what about Soverign Gold Bonds(SGBs)?
SGBs were previously considered one of the best options for gold investment, offering 2.5% interest per annum and tax-free capital gains on maturity. However, the <b>Government of India discontinued fresh issuances of SGBs after February 2024</b> due to rising fiscal pressure. Existing SGB holders can still sell on exchanges or redeem at maturity.

If you're looking for ease and flexibility, digital gold is a great entry point for gold investment. For regulatory safety and long-term cost-efficiency, gold ETFs shine. Physical gold remains ideal for those who value ownership and cultural traditions.
Most financial experts recommend allocating 5–10% of your total investment portfolio to gold, ideally balancing between digital, ETFs, and a small portion of physical assets.
Let your gold not just rest in your locker, but work in your portfolio too!
